## Title of the Project
PEER-TO-PEER RIDESHARING USING BLOCKCHAIN TWCHNOLOGY

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
A blockchain is a public ledger that stores and shares encrypted data among individuals who participate. The public ledger relies on consensus from the majority of participants to verify each transaction. Once entered, information cannot be deleted. The blockchain provides a verified record of all transactions. Taking a cookie from a private location is easier than snatching it from a crowded market place [1]. The Blockchain requires consensus among most candidates to modify the public log. Blockchain can be classed into three types: public, consortium, and private. Public blockchain allows all candidates to provide information and access, whereas collaborative allows just a cluster of candidates to participate. Private blockchain restricts access to the central organization. Satoshi Nakamoto's invention of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin marked the first use of Blockchain technology, which has since been effectively utilized [2]. 
In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto issued a paper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System". This study proposes a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that enables direct online payments between parties without relying on financial institutions. Bitcoin was the initial manifestation of this concept. The term "cryptocurrencies" refers to any network or means of exchange that uses cryptography to protect transactions, as opposed to systems that rely on a centralized trusted authority. A blockchain is a chronologically series of immutable transactions controlled by a network of computers using specialized computer algorithms. None of the signal entities own these unalterable records.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
Blockchain Node Servers: The system requires dedicated servers to run Ethereum nodes for blockchain transactions and smart contract execution. These servers should have sufficient processing power, memory, and storage to handle the decentralized nature of the blockchain.

Storage Infrastructure: Adequate storage is crucial for maintaining the blockchain's distributed ledger. A scalable and high-capacity storage solution is essential to accommodate the increasing volume of digital documents over time.

Secure User Devices: End-user devices, such as computers or mobile devices, should adhere to standard security protocols to ensure safe interactions with the digital locker. Secure devices contribute to the overall security of document retrieval and storage.

Blockchain Software: The system relies on Ethereum blockchain software for deploying and executing smart contracts. This includes Ethereum clients like Geth or Parity to run blockchain nodes.
Smart Contract Development Tools: Development tools for Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, are essential. Tools like Remix or Truffle can facilitate the creation, testing, and deployment of smart contracts.

Web Development Frameworks: The frontend of the system is built using React.js, necessitating the inclusion of Node.js for server-side rendering and Express.js for managing backend functionalities. These frameworks contribute to a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Encryption Libraries: Integration of encryption techniques requires cryptography libraries such as OpenSSL or libraries provided by programming languages to ensure secure document storage and data confidentiality.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
P2P ride-sharing with blockchain has the potential to revolutionize transportation. Imagine a network where riders and drivers connect directly, eliminating middleman fees and fostering transparency. This vision can be realized through a decentralized network powered by blockchain technology.  A user-friendly mobile app would allow riders to request rides, specify preferences, and track their journey, while drivers could manage availability, set fares, and receive secure payments.  Smart contracts on the blockchain would automate key processes like ride matching, secure payments using cryptocurrency, and even maintain a tamper-proof reputation system. Security and privacy would be paramount, with encryption and minimal data storage on the blockchain. By overcoming challenges like scalability and regulations, and fostering user adoption, this model has the potential to create a future of transportation that is efficient, transparent, and puts users in control.s
